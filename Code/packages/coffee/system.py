Modified by Ben Whale since then.

The abstract base class (abc) for System objects. This class serves to specify
the interface that System classes are assumed to have. These assumptions are
made by virtually all classes that call the system. For example, ibvp.IBVP,
subclasses of solver.Solver, almost all actions.hdf_actions.SimOutType
subclasses.

While you don't need to actually implement all the methods below, it really is
recomended. You may get errors about the methods missing as a consequence.

system.System has abc.ABCMeta as a meta class. This serves as a warning to
really think about what you are doing if you don't implement all methods below.

Classes:
System - an abc class that specifies the interface for subclasses of System
         that are assumed by all other classes in the coffee package.

        Yes I know it all sounds a bit vague. But really, this method is the
        heart and soul of coffee. You need to know what you're doing, how the
        solver is implemented and what data the system is meant to pass to the
        solver.

        Positional Arguments:
        t - the time at which the 'derivatives' need to be calculated. NOTE
            THAT THIS TIME MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THE TIME STORED IN u. The time
            stored in u is the time for the values of the functions stored in
            u, not the time at which the derivatives of the functions stored in
            u are needed. In the case of RK methods t and u.time can be
            different. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

        tslice - a tslice.TimeSlice object containing the data from which the

                  values of the functions being evolved at the next time slice.

        Yes this also makes the assumption that left is well defined. See the

        this method needs to be defined here. After all: does any class other
        than the system class need to access this method? If not there there is
        no need for it.

        Yes there is no grid object passed as an argument - deal with it. In
        other news, this will very likely change at some point.
